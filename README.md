Used STM32F4 discovery board with IMU as mouse for my laptop.
Major challenges involved are calibrating the IMU reading for smoother movements of the cursor.
There is a range of IMU readings where nothing should be done as the fluctuations are higher there even when the board is kept stable.
I have also controlled the led lights on board to show the movement direction.
